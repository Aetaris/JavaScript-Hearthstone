# Changelog

1.0: Original export from Cloud9 to GitHub. Not particularly interesting; a fairly bug-free build.

2.0: Fully ready to be play-tested by others, 2.0 includes new scenarios, player functionality, and a slightly cleaner look overall.

3.0: I swear I'll start actually adding 3.1 and 3.2, not just 4.0 :) This is the first release of the Sad Mystery adventure in which you accompany Arthas Menethil through the events of Warcraft III as he is slowly corrupted and ultimately destroyed. 3.0 includes the first three missions: "Blackrock & Roll", "Plagued Villages" and "Kel'Thuzad." All three are unique and fun, and should provide at least a bit of a challenge. Heroic versions may come out in the future!

3.1: Implemented the Choose One mechanic and introduced a large number of Druid cards. Also added the first batch of MSoG cards.

3.2: "Stratholme" has been added to Sad Mystery. To celebrate Diablo's 20th anniversary, I've also added scenarios for Leoric and Diablo - Malthael might come next! dealDamage function has been completely rewritten, Choose One added, and a large number of new cards put in.

4.0: Icecrown Citadel has arrived! Introducing 93 new cards, including 26 Legendaries, this adventure is exclusive to my simulator. Boss fights to come in 4.1! Maybe!
