# Changelog

1.0: Original export from Cloud9 to GitHub. Not particularly interesting; a fairly bug-free build.

2.0: Fully ready to be play-tested by others, 2.0 includes new scenarios, player functionality, and a slightly cleaner look overall.

3.0: I swear I'll start actually adding 3.1 and 3.2, not just 4.0 :) This is the first release of the Sad Mystery adventure in which you accompany Arthas Menethil through the events of Warcraft III as he is slowly corrupted and ultimately destroyed. 3.0 includes the first three missions: "Blackrock & Roll", "Plagued Villages" and "Kel'Thuzad." All three are unique and fun, and should provide at least a bit of a challenge. Heroic versions may come out in the future!
