Decks are created.
Decks battle. A deck is deleted if it loses. The winning deck "evolves" by loosing n random cards and gaining n random cards.
Repeat Step 2.

Decks are stored in files which names' are "keys" which are alphanumeric strings based on the cards of the deck. Inside the file is the deck in human readable format.
